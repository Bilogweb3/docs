# Tags

A [front matter](https://github.com/jxson/front-matter) attribute allows us to
define tags per file and a custom React component shows them as pills on the
website.

## Example

import Tags from "@/components/Tags";

<Tags />

## Usage

```mdx filename="tags.mdx"
---
tags: ["tutorial", "component"]
---

import Tags from "@/components/Tags";

<Tags />

# My new article

This is an example article with tags.
```

Please use array syntax for the front matter tags even if it's only a single
tag:

```mdx filename="single-tag.mdx"
---
tags: ["my-tag"]
---

import Tags from "@/components/Tags";

<Tags />

# My newest article

This is an example article with a single tag.
```
