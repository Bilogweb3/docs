## Basic Concepts

In order to understand how IBC works, it is important to understand some basic
concepts:

- **Port**: An identifier that corresponds to a single module on a chain. One
  module can have multiple ports. Each contract has its own unique port.
- **Channel**: A connection between two ports on different blockchains that
  allows them to send packets to each other. Each port can have multiple
  channels.
- **Relayer**: A service that is responsible for relaying packets between
  blockchains. Anyone can run a relayer.
- **Packet**: A piece of binary data that is sent through a channel. It can time
  out if it is not delivered within a certain time frame.

We will go into more detail on these concepts in the later sections, but this
should give you some basic terminology to start with. If you want to learn more
about IBC, you can read the [IBC specification] or check out the [IBC
documentation].
