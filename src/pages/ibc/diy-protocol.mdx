# Build your own protocol

In the following sections, we will guide you through the process of building
your own IBC protocol. We will cover how to establish a channel between two
chains, send and receive packets and how to handle timeouts and
acknowledgements.

## Entrypoints

To get an IBC-enabled contract, you need to implement a few IBC-specific
entrypoints.

Three for the channel lifecycle:

- `ibc_channel_open`
- `ibc_channel_connect`
- `ibc_channel_close`

And three for the packet lifecycle:

- `ibc_packet_receive`
- `ibc_packet_ack`
- `ibc_packet_timeout`

We will explain what these are for in the next sections, but it is important to
understand that you need to implement **all** of these entrypoints to get a
working IBC contract. You can always return errors in some of them if that makes
sense for your protocol, but you need to have them all.
