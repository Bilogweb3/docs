# Using Existing Protocols

The easiest way to use IBC is to use an already existing protocol. These
protocols can either be implemented by the chain itself or by another contract.

One example for the former is the `IbcMsg::Transfer` message, which causes an
ICS 20 transfer. This message is included in the CosmWasm standard library and
causes the chain's IBC Transfer module to send tokens to another chain.

An example for the latter is the Nois protocol. It provides a proxy contract
that handles all the IBC logic for you. For more information on Nois, check the
[Nois documentation](https://docs.nois.network/dapp_devs/use_nois_randomness.html).

## Example: `IbcMsg::Transfer`

TODO

- add example code

## ADR-8: IBC Callbacks

TODO

- needs to be supported by the chain
- two new entrypoints
- needs to be enabled for each message (show example transfer)
