# Measuring time

Accessing the current time is useful in a lot of different contexts but time is
hard. It is hard to coordinate, hard to keep in sync, and this gets worse in
distributed settings such as blockchains.

In CosmWasm, we solve this by passing you some information about the blockchain
you are running on whenever en entrypoint is invoked.

In each of the entrypoints, you get a parameter of the type `Env` and this
struct contains the field `block`. The struct contained in this field has a
bunch of different information about the current state of the blockchain you are
running on.

The timestamp contained in this struct can be safely used in your program as the
source of the current time. Well, kinda. It won't be 100% matching the current
time, as it will only definitely match the time the latest block on the
blockchain as of the invocation of your contract.

But you can rely on this timestamp to have the following properties:

- Consistent across the chain (every validator on the chain has the same info)
- Monotonic (it will ever only increase or stay the same; never decrease)
