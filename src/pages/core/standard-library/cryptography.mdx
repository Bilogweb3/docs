# Cryptography

CosmWasm offers cryptographic primitives that are implemented as VM intrinsics.
This means that they are more efficient than implementations in contract code
could be, saving you gas. In some cases they are also _impossible_ to implement
in contract code, since some of them require a random intermediate value and
randomness is generally not exposed to contracts to ensure deterministic
execution.

In the sidebar, you can find all the supported algorithms/curves along with
documentation about them.

If you are looking for a list of gas costs for these operations, you can find
them in the
[source code](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/packages/vm/src/environment.rs#L63-L92).
