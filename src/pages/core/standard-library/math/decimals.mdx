# Decimals

CosmWasm offers decimal types for handling fractional numbers.

In contrast to floating point numbers, these datatypes do not suffer from the
same precision issues. This means that these decimal types are safe for use in
financial calculations.

Instead of storing numbers in the floating point format, which gives it a
_floating_ amount of decimal places, these decimal types have a fixed precision
of 18 decimal places.

These decimal types come in two variants:

- `Decimal`: 128-bit
- `Decimal256`: 256-bit

Choose one of the types according to your needs and off you go!
