# Integers

CosmWasm offers integer types starting at 64 bit precision, all the way up to
512 bits.

Reasoning behind wrapping the native 64 bit type is the interaction with
JavaScript. A `u64` would normally serialize into a regular integer field in
JSON. The issue here is that, due to representing integers in form of double
precision floats, JavaScript can only handle up to ~53 bit numbers without
potentially losing information.

Our wrapper fixes this by serializing numbers as strings, letting JavaScript
clients deserialize these numbers into their respective BigInteger types.

The other integer types, which reach even higher amounts of precision, are
serialized in the same way.

Integers come in the following variants:

{ // Beware: Overengineering ahead!

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Unsigned</th>
                <th>Signed</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            {
                [ '64', '128', '256', '512' ]
                    .map(item => (
                        <tr key={item}>
                            <td>{item} bit</td>
                            <td><code>Uint{item}</code></td>
                            <td><code>Int{item}</code></td>
                        </tr>
                    ))
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>

}
