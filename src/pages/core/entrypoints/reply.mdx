# Reply

The `reply` endpoint is another special one.

It relates to CosmWasm's actor model which dictates how you call other contracts
and interact with them.

<Callout>TODO: Link to the actor model section once we have one</Callout>

This endpoint gets invoked when you receive a response to a message you sent out
over the chain. The reply parameter then allows you to inspect and work with the
response that was produced.

## Definition

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[entry_point]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: cosmwasm_std::Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```
