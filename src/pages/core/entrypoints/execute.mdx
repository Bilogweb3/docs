# Execute

Execute pretty much does what it says on the tin: It executes some routine in
your contract after a remote (either another contract or some client) sent a
message.  
What sets it apart from other functions is that the contract has mutable access
to the underlying storage.  
This allows you to, for example, increment a counter or add a user to a lottery.

## Definition

```rust filename="contract.rs" template="core"
#[entry_point]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
  // Increment some counter, register a user, spread liberty for super earth!
  Ok(Response::new())
}
```
