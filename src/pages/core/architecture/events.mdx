# Events

CosmWasm can emit
[Cosmos Events](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/events). These
events are stored in the block as metadata, allowing the contract to attach
metadata to what exactly happened during execution.

By default CosmWasm emits the `wasm` event to which you can add context like so:

```rust filename="wasm_event.rs" template="core"
let response: Response<Empty> = Response::new()
    .add_attribute("custom_attribute", "value");
```

## Custom events

As mentioned above, CosmWasm only emits the event `wasm` by default. If you want
to emit other events, such as domain-specific events like `user_added`, you can
construct a fully custom event and attach it to the response.

```rust filename="custom_event.rs" template="core"
let event = Event::new("custom_event")
    .add_attribute("custom_attribute", "value");

let response: Response<Empty> = Response::new()
    .add_event(event);
```
