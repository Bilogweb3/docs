# IBC

Although Sylvia does not generate any [IBC](../../ibc) related code you can
define your own [IBC entry points](../../ibc/diy-protocol#Entrypoints) like you
would in the case of a regular CosmWasm contract.

To access the state, create an instance of the contract like so:

```rust
let contract = Contract::new();

contract.your_state.load(deps.storage);
```

or if you decide to define the logic inside the contract or a trait:

```rust
Contract::new().your_method(deps, env, param1, ..);
```
