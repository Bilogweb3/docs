# Installation

**`MultiTest`** ships as a Rust library named
[cw-multi-test](https://crates.io/crates/cw-multi-test).

To use **`MultiTest`** for building and testing smart contracts, add it as a
**development dependency** to your project:

```toml filename="Cargo.toml"
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "2"
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">
  **`MultiTest`** is a _**testing**_ library and should always be added to your
  project as **DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCY** in section **`[dev-dependencies]`** of
  the **Cargo.toml** file.
</Callout>

### Prerequisities

The only prerequisite to build and test smart contracts using **`MultiTest`** is
having [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

Optionally, you may want to install
[Tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin) for measuring code coverage
and [Nextest](https://nexte.st) for running tests faster, with clean and
beautiful user interface.

Installing **Tarpaulin**:

```shell
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

Installing **Nextest**:

```shell
cargo install cargo-nextest
```
