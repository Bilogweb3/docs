# How to doc

The next articles will teach you the basics for writing documentation using
[Nextra](https://nextra.site/):

- [MDX](/how-to-doc/mdx): general MDX syntax and how to use it in Nextra.
- [Tags](/how-to-doc/tags): how to assign tags per file for extra grouping.
- [Callout](/how-to-doc/callout): how to use the Callout component for
  attracting attention.
- [Tabs](/how-to-doc/tabs): a Tabs component for switching between related
  content.

Please use the `.mdx` extension for the documentation files, so that tags can be
properly generated and you can use React components inside.

You can also check out Nextra's [official docs](https://nextra.site/docs) for
more information.
