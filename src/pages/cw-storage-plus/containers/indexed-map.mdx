# `IndexedMap`

An
[`IndexedMap`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html)
is a map that, apart from the usual map key (`K`) has some secondary indexes
(`I`) that can be used to look up values.

<Callout>
There's no limit to how many indexes you can have, but be careful. Using many indexes can increase the complexity of
storage writes - with every write, the list of indexes is iterated over since
they might need to be updated.
</Callout>

As always, we encourage you to explore the
[`API reference`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html)
for a full list of available methods and more rigid definitions of the types
involved.

## Case study: User lookup

Imagine we have a list of users. Every user is uniquely identified by their
address, so it makes sense to use that as the primary key. We'll need to look up
users by their address - if Alice calls the contract, we should be able to look
up her user data by the address with which she called.

</Callout>

This is easy to model with a normal `Map`.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::Map;

type Handle = String;

#[cw_serde]
struct User {
    handle: Handle,
    country: String,
}

let _users = Map::<Addr, User>::new("u");
```

Great! But what if we want to look up users by their handles? Our only real
option here is to iterate over all users and check if the handle matches. With a
big enough user base, this could be slow and expensive.

### Setting up an `IndexedMap` with a `UniqueIndex`

A better way would be to maintain a secondary index. Let's try to do this.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::{index_list, IndexedMap, UniqueIndex};

use crate::users::*;

#[index_list(User)]
struct UserIndexes<'a> {
    handle_ix: UniqueIndex<'a, Handle, User, Addr>,
}

let user_indexes = UserIndexes {
    handle_ix: UniqueIndex::new(|user| user.handle.clone(), "uh"),
};

let _users = IndexedMap::<Addr, _, _>::new("u", user_indexes);
```

Here's what happens step-by-step

- We define a struct `UserIndexes` that holds all the indexes we want to use. In
  this case, we only have one index - `handle`, indexing the `handle` field.
- We construct our `UserIndexes`. Notice the `UniqueIndex` constructor takes two
  parameters:
  - A closure. This closure is supposed to take the value of an entry and
    produce the secondary key. Without this, the `IndexedMap` would not know how
    to create the index.
  - A prefix. The index needs its own storage namespace. Note the index prefix
    has to be distinct from the `IndexedMap` prefix (or any other prefix used
    with this contract's storage).
- We construct an `IndexedMap` with that list of indexes.

<Callout type="warning">
If you're using
  [`UniqueIndex`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.UniqueIndex.html),
  it's your responsibility to ensure that the index you've built has unique
  keys. If you have two users with the same handle, the index will be
  overwritten and only contain the last user. Be careful!
  
  If you need to store a key that is not unique, you'll want to use a [`MultiIndex`](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.MultiIndex.html) - see the [next section](#lookup-by-country).
</Callout>

<Callout>
Under the hood, the `IndexedMap` will store the data using a regular `Map` for
the primary key, and then another `Map` for each secondary index. This is how efficient lookups are achieved.

Again, every update to this storage structure will have to update all the
indexes - that's the price we pay for efficient lookups.

</Callout>

### Taking advantage of the secondary index

As with a regular `Map`, you can
[load data](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html#method.load),
[save](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html#method.save)
data,
[remove](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/latest/cw_storage_plus/struct.IndexedMap.html#method.remove)
data, and iterate over the `IndexedMap`.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::IndexedMap;

use crate::users::*;

let users = IndexedMap::<Addr, _, _>::new("u", user_indexes("uh"));

let alice_addr = Addr::unchecked("alice");
let alice_user = User {
    handle: "alice".to_string(),
    country: "Wonderland".to_string(),
};

let bob_addr = Addr::unchecked("bob");
let bob_user = User {
    handle: "bob".to_string(),
    country: "Bikini Bottom".to_string(),
};

users
    .save(&mut storage, alice_addr.clone(), &alice_user)
    .unwrap();

users
    .save(&mut storage, bob_addr.clone(), &bob_user)
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    users.load(&storage, Addr::unchecked("alice")).unwrap(),
    alice_user
);

assert_eq!(
    users
        .range(&storage, None, None, Order::Ascending)
        .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
        .unwrap(),
    vec![
        (alice_addr.clone(), alice_user.clone()),
        (bob_addr.clone(), bob_user.clone()),
    ]
);
```

But now we can also look up users by their handle.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::IndexedMap;

use crate::users::*;

let (_key, alice) = users
    .idx
    .handle_ix                           // access the `handle_ix` index
    .item(&storage, "alice".to_string()) // load a specific record
    .unwrap()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(
    alice,
    User {
        handle: "alice".to_string(),
        country: "Wonderland".to_string(),
    }
);
```

We can also iterate over records using bounds based on the secondary index.
Here's how we can find all user handles starting with "a" or "b".

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::{Bound, IndexedMap};

use crate::users::*;

let found_users = users
    .idx
    .handle_ix
    .range(
        &storage,
        Some(Bound::inclusive("a")),
        Some(Bound::exclusive("c")),
        Order::Ascending,
    )
    .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(found_users.len(), 2);
assert_eq!(
    found_users[0],
    (
        Addr::unchecked("alice"),
        User {
            handle: "alice".to_string(),
            country: "Wonderland".to_string(),
        }
    )
);
assert_eq!(found_users[1].1.handle, "bob");
```

If we're only interested in the addresses (primary keys in our case), we can use
the `keys` method.

```rust template="storage"
use cw_storage_plus::{Bound, IndexedMap};

use crate::users::*;

let found_keys = users
    .idx
    .handle_ix
    .keys(&storage, Some(Bound::inclusive("b")), None, Order::Ascending)
    .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(found_keys.len(), 2);
assert_eq!(found_keys[0], Addr::unchecked("bob"));
assert_eq!(found_keys[1], Addr::unchecked("carol"));
```
