# Tutorial

This module is a collection of guides for creating CosmWasm smart contracts. It will lead you step
by step, and explain relevant topics from the easiest to the trickier ones.

The idea of these tutorials is not only to tell you about smart contracts API but also to show you
how to do it in a clean and maintainable way. We will show you patterns that CosmWasm creators
established and encouraged you to use.
