# Introduction

**`MultiTest`** is a suite of testing tools designed for facilitating
multi-contract interactions within the CosmWasm ecosystem. Its primary focus is
on providing developers with a robust framework for testing complex contract
interactions and several Cosmos modules operations.

<Callout type="info">
  MultiTest is a **simulator** of the blockchain, allowing tested smart
  contracts to interact as if they were operating on the real-life blockchain.
</Callout>

The most valuable advantage of using **`MultiTest`** is that it allows you to
test and debug smart contracts with access to Rust source code, eliminating the
need to run a complete blockchain node to begin designing smart contract
functionality.

The disadvantage is that **`MultiTest`** is a blockchain simulator, and it is
possible that the behavior of the real-life blockchain may slightly differ in
edge cases from the simulated model. In such cases, we strongly encourage you to
[file an issue](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-multi-test/issues) with a
detailed description of the use case to help us improve **`MultiTest`**.

In the upcoming chapters, we will provide detailed instructions on installing
and getting started with **`MultiTest`**, writing unit tests for smart
contracts, testing complex interactions between smart contracts and testing
smart contract interactions with Cosmos modules.

By the end of these chapters, you will have a comprehensive understanding of
using **`MultiTest`** for testing and debugging smart contracts in various
scenarios.
