# Basics

Storey is an abstraction layer that can be adapted to a binary KV store,
providing a typed API with a number of conveniences. This abstraction layer
lives in the [`storey`](https://docs.rs/storey/latest/storey/) crate.

This abstraction layer has been integrated with the Cosmos/CosmWasm storage API.
The integration lives in the
[`cw-storey`](https://docs.rs/cw-storey/latest/cw_storey/) crate. Since you
likely came here wanting to build CosmWasm contracts, this is the crate you'll
be interacting with for basic things.

## Containers

Storey provides some tools to build and compose ["containers"](containers). This
section is probably the most relevant for practical contract development.

## Keys encoding

`storey` does a lot of key management for you, and doesn't use any particular
encoding scheme for that. The encoding scheme is a combination of:

- One-byte keys provided to `storey` containers
- The particular way a given container decides to use that key - it might save
  something under that key directly, and/or it might append to it. In a way, a
  container has a whole namespace of keys carved out for it to manage.

## Value encoding

Storey provides the `Encoding` trait, which describes how to serialize and
deserialize values. While for CosmWasm contracts you'll likely be using the
default [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org) encoding, you can switch out for
another one if you want, and you can do that granularly for each container. If
you need to integrate some other encoding, see the
[_Alternative encodings_](encodings) section.

## Alternative backends

The `storey` crate can be integrated with other storage backends. This is done
via the
[`StorageBackend`](https://docs.rs/storey/latest/storey/storage/trait.StorageBackend.html)
and
[`StorageBackendMut`](https://docs.rs/storey/latest/storey/storage/trait.StorageBackendMut.html)
traits. The process is described in the [_Alternative backends_](backend)
section.
